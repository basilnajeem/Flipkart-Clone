# Flipkart-Clone (Sample Version)

Welcome to my sample version of the Flipkart Page clone! This project was created as a study exercise to help me learn HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap coding. Please note that this version may not include all the features of the original Flipkart platform.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Usage:

To view the Flipkart Landing Page clone, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: `git clone` followed by http or ssh link.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

Please keep in mind that this is a basic version created solely for learning purposes and may not provide the full functionality or content of the actual Flipkart website. It serves as a starting point for understanding HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap concepts and practicing your web development skills.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with modifications, and enhance your understanding of web development. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!😊
